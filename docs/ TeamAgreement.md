contribute?

    Team leader ensure that tasks are distributed efficiently between the members so everyone can contribute and prevent anybody from doing more than he/she is assigned to.

    It is okay to help each other with tasks if someone is stuck or facing a problem in completing a task.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing and How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  
    If a member is not not adequately contributing, the team leader will tell the member of it, asking him/her if they are facing any problem that prevents required contribution.
